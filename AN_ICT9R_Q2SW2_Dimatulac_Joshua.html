<ul><li> <font size="+2">Dobermanns, also known as Doberman Pinschers, are a medium-sized breed of domestic dog that Louis Dobermann first developed around 1890. The muzzle of the Dobermann is lengthy. It often does not have heavy feet and stands on its pads. Ideally, they walk with a smooth gait. The tail is docked, and the ears are typically trimmed and posted. The chest, paws, legs, muzzle, area above the eyes, and underneath the tail are all marked on dobermanns. Dobermanns are renowned for being wise, perceptive, and fiercely devoted friends and guard dogs.</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size="+2">Pomeranian, a longtime favorite of both royalty and commoners, is the perfect companion. The magnificent coat, happy, foxy face, and vibrant nature of the Pom have made it one of the most well-liked toy breeds in the world. The Pomeranian is a small dog with an authoritative big-dog attitude. For families with kids old enough to understand the difference between a toy dog and a toy, Pomeranians make excellent watchdogs and cheerful companions since they are alert, smart, and easy to train.</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size="+2">The dog's intimidating exterior conceals its sensitive nature. American Bullies are extremely lovable and cozy. It is jokingly said: a bully as a guard dog would even help the burglar to carry because they like to please people. The Bully is a capable protector because of its appearance. The animal stands up for what matters, it is open-minded and tolerant of outsiders.</font></li></ul></td>
